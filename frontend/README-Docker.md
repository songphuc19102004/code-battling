# Frontend Docker Integration Updates

This document outlines the updates made to the frontend to support the new Docker-based code execution system in the golang-realtime backend.

## Overview

The frontend has been enhanced to work seamlessly with the Docker-based code execution system, providing users with better feedback, multi-language support, and improved error handling.

## New Features

### 1. Multi-Language Support
- **Language Selector**: Added dropdown to choose between JavaScript, Python, and Go
- **Language Templates**: Automatic code templates for each supported language
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Monaco Editor now adapts syntax highlighting based on selected language
- **Language Normalization**: Frontend automatically normalizes language names for backend compatibility

### 2. Enhanced Execution Feedback
- **Real-time Status**: Visual indicators showing Docker container execution progress
- **Execution States**: Clear feedback for different execution phases:
  - 🐳 "Executing code in Docker container..."
  - ⏳ "Code submitted to execution queue..."
  - ✅ "Code executed successfully!"
  - ⚠️ "Execution timeout" (for long-running code)

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- **Docker-Specific Errors**: Better formatting for container execution errors
- **Language-Specific Errors**: Tailored error messages for different programming languages
- **Timeout Management**: 30-second timeout with user-friendly timeout messages
- **Error Categories**: Categorized error types (Syntax, Reference, Type, Memory, etc.)

### 4. Execution Management
- **Submission Protection**: Prevents multiple simultaneous submissions
- **State Management**: Proper cleanup of execution state and UI elements
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during code execution with disabled submit button
- **Auto-cleanup**: Automatic removal of status messages after completion

## Technical Changes

### Language Normalization
The frontend now maps user-friendly language names to backend-expected identifiers:
```javascript
javascript -> js
python -> python
go -> go
```

### Execution Flow
1. User selects language and writes code
2. Frontend validates input and shows loading state
3. Code is normalized and submitted to Docker execution backend
4. Real-time status updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
5. Results displayed with appropriate success/error formatting
6. UI state cleaned up automatically

### Error Message Processing
Docker execution errors are processed and formatted for better user experience:
- Syntax errors are highlighted and simplified
- Timeout errors explain potential infinite loops
- Memory errors suggest optimization
- Language-specific errors provide targeted advice

## Code Templates

### JavaScript
```javascript
// Write your solution here
function solve() {
    return true;
}
```

### Python
```python
# Write your solution here
def solve():
    return True
```

### Go
```go
// Write your solution here
package main

func solve() bool {
    return true
}
```

## UI Components

### New HTML Elements
- `#language-selector`: Dropdown for language selection
- `.editor-controls`: Container for editor configuration controls
- `.execution-status`: Dynamic status messages during execution

### Enhanced Elements
- `#submit-button`: Now shows loading states and execution progress
- `#error-log-container`: Enhanced with better error categorization
- `#editor-section`: Contains execution status and progress indicators

## API Integration

### Request Format
The frontend now sends properly normalized language identifiers:
```javascript
{
  "question_id": 1,
  "room_id": roomId,
  "language": "js",  // Normalized language
  "code": userCode,
  "player_id": playerId,
  "submitted_at": timestamp
}
```

### Event Handling
Enhanced SSE event processing for Docker execution results:
- `CORRECT_SOLUTION_SUBMITTED`: Shows success message with execution confirmation
- `WRONG_SOLUTION_SUBMITTED`: Processes Docker error output with formatting
- Timeout handling for long-running Docker executions

## Performance Considerations

- **Execution Timeout**: 30-second timeout prevents UI lockup from infinite loops
- **State Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks from execution state
- **Error Processing**: Client-side error formatting reduces backend load
- **Health Checks**: Lightweight backend health verification

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Monaco Editor compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) support required
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layout

## Future Enhancements

- **Execution Metrics**: Display execution time and memory usage
- **Code Saving**: Local storage for code persistence
- **Execution History**: Track previous submissions and results
- **Advanced Error Analysis**: More detailed error categorization and suggestions
